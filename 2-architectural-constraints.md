# 2, Architectural Constraints

## Architectural Goals

Integration Goals for Knight Frank’s Systems with Frontify Marketing material services:

* Standardise Brochure Generation:
  * Implement consistent methods for creating brochures.
* Standardise Data Integration, Reporting, and Export:
  * Ensure uniform approaches for data handling and reporting.
* Utilise Current Patterns for Gathering Usage Information:
  * Adopt existing methods to collect and analyze usage data.
* Reduce Brochure Generation Time:
  * Streamline processes to create brochures more quickly.
* Control Brochure Look and Feel with Marketing Templates:
  * Maintain a consistent design using marketing-approved templates.

## Architectural Principles

The proposed pattern architecture aligns to our current Group Technology Principles as follows:

| # | Principle                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAG   |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1 | Cloud-First and Microsoft-Considered Strategy                        | This service, like all services defined are written to take advantages of cloud-first design, and are only cloud vendor specific where they need to be.                                                   | Green |
| 2 | Design in a modular way and think of re-use                          | The service integration pattern follows previously defined services, and shares many components.                                                                                                          | Green |
| 3 | High Cohesion and Low Coupling – Favour Asynchronous Communication​  | This service utilises a service-bus architecture, decoupling it from specific client applications, enabling it to be used by all.                                                                         | Green |
| 4 | Software Should be Verifiable                                        | This service has been designed with the view that all components will be highly testable, and fully meet the requirements of a CI/CD strategy.                                                            | Green |
| 5 | Think Global, Build Local                                            | This service has been specified to be location agnostic.                                                                                                                                                  | Green |
| 6 | Configuration over Customisation                                     | Any cloud service must facilitate run-time behaviour (configuration) changes via a self-serve administrator portal. This SAD includes the resources to enable this capability by default                  | Green |
| 7 | Build with Privacy-as-Default with a risk-based approach to security | The pattern architecture will mandate a standards-based approach to resource authentication (Managed Identity), user authorisation (role-based access control) and both user and system activity auditing | Green |

## Architecture Constraints

* External generation of marketing material should follow Knight Franks security and access rules concerning all clients, and especially clients with restricted access, such as high net worth and clients with NDA's
* Marketing material should not persist on external sites longer than is necessary to complete the task.
  * This is to avoid possible security leaks
  * Minimise storage costs
* Access to the service will follow current approved security and access rules.
  * Managed Identity to provide resource access.
  * User Identity optional, as calling systems will have already authenticated the user.
    * If User Identity is passed then it should be validated.
  * User Identity to satisfy audit.
